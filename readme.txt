Gives you a price table post type, with an easy to use builder and an attractive design.

== Description ==

This plugin gives you a drag and drop interface for building price tables. It also renders those price tables using pure CSS3. They have a clean, minimal design - so they'll fit into just about any design. Thanks Orman for the [great design](http://www.premiumpixels.com/freebies/simple-pricing-table-psd/)!

I've checked the design with most modern browsers, except Internet Explorer. It should work with IE8 and above. Please contact me if you spot any IE issues greg@siteorigin.com.
